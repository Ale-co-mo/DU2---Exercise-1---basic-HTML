    <h1>HORSES</h1>
    <p>The horse <strong>(Equus ferus caballus)</strong> is a domesticated, one-toed, 
        hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is 
        one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved 
        over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature,
         close to Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. 
         Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication 
         is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies 
         caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in 
         the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, 
         which are horses that never have been domesticated and historically linked 
         to the megafauna category of species. There is an extensive, specialized 
         vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from 
         anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.
